# About

This repository contains what is needed to solve the second assigment in the course "Webbutveckling i ramverket för .NET" ("Webdevelopment with the .NET framework") winter 2018 at [Teknikhögskolan Gothenburg](https://github.com/TeknikhogskolanGothenburg).

# Assignment

* Swedish [Assignment.sv.md](assignment.sv.md)
* English [Assignment.en.md](assignment.en.md)

If there is a difference between the swedish and english assignment description, the swedish one is the correct one.

## Getting started

Make sure everybody in the team have a github account.

A github assignment is created and everybody will recive an invite to this, the scrummaster will create the team and the rest of the teammembers joins this team. The team will get a repository containing all code.

Everybody in the team should now clone the teams webserver-repo, and be able to push to it.
